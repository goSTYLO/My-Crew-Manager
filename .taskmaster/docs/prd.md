Project Name: MyCrewManager: AI-Powered Sprint & Backlog Assistant

0. Current Focus

Objective: Focus on coding and implementing the AI/LLM setup for task parsing and backlog automation.

Set up the LLM pipeline to process PDF proposals and generate structured project data.

Integrate AI for task generation, roles extraction, and sprint planning.

Ensure system readiness for developers to interact with tasks via the sprint feed.

Only generate tasks that involve coding, AI integration, or core backend/frontend setup for the LLM pipeline.

1. Executive Summary

MyCrewManager is an AI-driven project management platform designed to automate sprint planning, backlog generation, and team collaboration. The system enables project managers to upload proposals, automatically generate structured backlogs (epics, sub-epics, user stories), and organize tasks into sprints. Developers interact with tasks through a sprint feed, log voice check-ins, and receive gamified achievements. AI serves as the Sprint Architect, parsing proposals and building actionable plans.

Current Priority: Implement and validate the AI/LLM pipeline for proposal parsing, task generation, and sprint initialization.

2. Objectives & Scope

Objectives:

Automate parsing of project proposals into structured plans via AI/LLM.

Provide project managers with tools to manage members, sprints, and backlogs.

Allow developers to view and update tasks, log progress via voice check-ins, and gain achievements.

Generate reports in PDF/CSV format for monitoring and progress tracking.

Scope:

Upload & parse PDF proposals into structured data.

AI/LLM setup for backlog hierarchy generation (Epics ‚Üí Sub-Epics ‚Üí User Stories ‚Üí Tasks).

Sprint management with role-based task assignment.

Developer tools for task updates, voice logs, and gamification.

Reporting features for project monitoring.
