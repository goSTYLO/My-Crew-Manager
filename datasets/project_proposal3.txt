Project Title​
Horizon — Intelligent Systems for Evolving Workflows
Project Description​
Horizon is an exploratory initiative aimed at understanding how adaptive intelligence can
enhance team workflows in dynamic, fast-changing environments. The system is expected to
evolve alongside user needs, offering contextual support, automation, and insight generation
without relying on rigid structures or predefined roles.
Objective​
To explore how intelligent systems can support evolving team workflows in dynamic
environments.
Scope​
The system should adapt to changing user needs and provide meaningful support across
multiple phases of work. It may involve automation, data handling, and some form of insight
generation.
Team Composition​
A small team will be formed. Specific roles and responsibilities will be defined as the project
evolves.
