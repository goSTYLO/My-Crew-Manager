Project Title: Project Nova — Adaptive Intelligence for Team Workflows
Objective:​
To build a system that enhances team coordination and decision-making using intelligent
automation.
Scope:​
The platform should support task management, progress tracking, and some form of AI-driven
insight generation. It may involve document handling, user interaction, and integration with
existing tools.
Team Composition:​
A small cross-functional team will be assembled. Roles may include development, design, and
AI expertise.
Timeline:​
The project is expected to span several weeks, with phased development and iterative testing.
Resources:​
Basic infrastructure will be provided. Access to relevant libraries and datasets may be arranged
as needed.
Risks:​
Potential challenges include integration complexity, unclear user needs, and model
performance variability.
Success Criteria:​
The system should demonstrate improved workflow efficiency and provide meaningful
recommendations. Usability and reproducibility will be key.
