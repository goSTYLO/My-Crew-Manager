# Real-time WebSocket and Notification System - Manual Testing Guide

## üéØ Testing Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for manually testing the comprehensive real-time collaboration system described in the README. The system includes:

- **Real-time WebSocket Integration** - Live project updates across all team members
- **Notification System** - Instant notifications via WebSocket connections  
- **Toast Notifications** - Professional toast notifications with actor information
- **Multi-user Collaboration** - Real-time updates across multiple browser sessions

## üöÄ Prerequisites

### 1. Start the Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Django server
python manage.py runserver

# Terminal 2: Start React frontend
cd web
npm run dev
```

### 2. Verify Server Status
- **Django API**: http://localhost:8000/api/ai/ (should return API endpoints)
- **React App**: http://localhost:5173 (should show the application)
- **Django Admin**: http://localhost:8000/admin/ (for user management)

## üîç Browser Developer Tools Testing

### Network Tab Monitoring
1. **WebSocket Connection**:
   - Look for `ws://localhost:8000/ws/notifications/` connection
   - Verify connection status shows as "101 Switching Protocols"
   - Monitor WebSocket frames for real-time messages

2. **API Calls**:
   - Monitor XHR/Fetch requests to `/api/ai/` endpoints
   - Verify proper authentication headers
   - Check response times and status codes

### Console Monitoring
1. **WebSocket Messages**:
   ```javascript
   // Check WebSocket connection status
   console.log('WebSocket status:', window.websocketStatus);
   
   // Monitor real-time events
   // Look for messages like:
   // "Project updated:", "Task assigned:", "Member joined:", etc.
   ```

2. **Error Monitoring**:
   - Watch for JavaScript errors
   - Monitor WebSocket connection errors
   - Check for API call failures

### Application Tab (Chrome DevTools)
1. **Local Storage**:
   - Verify authentication tokens are stored
   - Check for any cached data

2. **Session Storage**:
   - Monitor real-time state management
   - Check for WebSocket connection data

## üìä Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Successful Test Indicators
- WebSocket connections establish and maintain
- Real-time updates appear instantly across all users
- Toast notifications show with correct actor information
- No JavaScript errors in browser console
- All API calls return successful status codes
- System handles network interruptions gracefully

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators
- WebSocket connection failures
- Delayed or missing real-time updates
- Missing toast notifications
- JavaScript errors in console
- API call failures (4xx, 5xx status codes)
- System crashes or freezes

## üêõ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### WebSocket Connection Issues
- **Problem**: WebSocket fails to connect
- **Solution**: Check Django server is running, verify WebSocket URL, check authentication

### Missing Real-time Updates
- **Problem**: Changes don't appear in real-time
- **Solution**: Verify WebSocket connection, check browser console for errors, refresh page

### Authentication Issues
- **Problem**: API calls return 401 Unauthorized
- **Solution**: Check authentication token in localStorage, re-login if needed

### Toast Notifications Not Appearing
- **Problem**: No toast notifications for real-time events
- **Solution**: Check WebSocket connection, verify toast context is properly initialized
