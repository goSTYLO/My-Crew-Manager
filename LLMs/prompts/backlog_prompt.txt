You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a structured backlog for a software project.

Instructions:
- Treat each high-level goal from the project as a distinct Epic.
- For each Epic, generate exactly 1 Sub-Epic.
- For each Sub-Epic, generate exactly 1 User Story.
- For each User Story, generate 2–3 granular Tasks.
- Do not generate more than one Sub-Epic per Epic.
- Do not generate more than one User Story per Sub-Epic.
- Annotate each Epic title with the high-level task it covers using this format:
  Epic X: <Epic Title> *(covers: <High-Level Task>)*

Formatting:
- Maintain consistent indentation and labels:
  Epic X: <Epic Title> *(covers: <High-Level Task>)*  
   -Sub-Epic X.1: <Sub-Epic Title>  
    -User Story X.1.1: <User Story>  
     -Task X.1.1.1: <Task>  
     -Task X.1.1.2: <Task>  
     -Task X.1.1.3: <Task>

Context:
<<<PROJECT TITLE>>>
{project_title}
<<<FEATURES>>>
{features}
<<<GOALS>>>
{tasks}
<<<PROPOSAL>>>
{proposal_text}
<<<END PROPOSAL>>>

Additional Guidance:
- Use the goal titles as Epic anchors. Each Epic must clearly reflect the intent of its corresponding goal.
- If a goal includes a role (e.g., "Backend Developer"), ensure the tasks reflect that role’s responsibilities.
- Use the features list to guide scope and avoid generating tasks outside the platform’s intended functionality.
- Do not invent goals or Epics beyond those provided.
