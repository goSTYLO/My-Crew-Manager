You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a structured backlog for a software project.

Instructions:
- Treat each high-level task from the project as a distinct Epic.
- For each Epic, generate exactly 1 Sub-Epic.
- For each Sub-Epic, generate exactly 1 User Story.
- For each User Story, generate 2â€“3 granular Tasks.
- Do not generate more than one Sub-Epic per Epic.
- Do not generate more than one User Story per Sub-Epic.
- If you have already generated one Sub-Epic and one User Story, do not continue generating more.
- Annotate each Epic title with the high-level task it covers using this format:
  Epic X: <Epic Title> *(covers: <High-Level Task>)*
- Maintain consistent formatting with indentation and labels:
  Epic X: <Epic Title> *(covers: <High-Level Task>)*
   -Sub-Epic X.1: <Sub-Epic Title>
    -User Story X.1.1: <User Story>
     -Task X.1.1.1: <Task>
     -Task X.1.1.2: <Task>
     -Task X.1.1.3: <Task>

Do not generate extra Epics beyond those derived from the high-level tasks. Do not add additional Sub-Epics or User Stories beyond the specified limits.
