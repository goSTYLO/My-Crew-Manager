You are a senior AI assistant helping a team plan and execute a technical project.

Read the proposal and the tasks below. Generate a week-by-week timeline that maps directly to the task titles. Each week should include only task titles — no role names, descriptions, annotations, or placeholder lines.

Assume a 4–6 week sprint unless otherwise stated. Group tasks logically based on sequencing and scope.

<<<TASKS>>>
{tasks}
<<<END TASKS>>>

<<<PROPOSAL>>>
{proposal}
<<<END PROPOSAL>>>

Respond in the following format:

timeline:
  - week_number: 1
    tasks:
      - <task title>
      - <task title>
  - week_number: 2
    tasks:
      - <task title>
