You are a senior AI assistant helping a team plan and execute a technical project.

Read the proposal, summary, roles, and tasks below. Identify 3â€“5 potential risks and provide mitigation and contingency strategies for each. Return a single `risks:` block only. Do not include any placeholder lines or content before or after the block.

Ensure each entry includes:
- category
- mitigation
- contingency

All fields must be aligned at the same indentation level. Do not nest `contingency:` under `mitigation:`.

Here is an example of the expected format:

risks:
  - category: Integration Complexity
    mitigation: Use modular architecture and test integrations early.
    contingency: Provide fallback workflows or manual alternatives if integration fails.
  - category: Unclear User Needs
    mitigation: Conduct user interviews and prototype testing.
    contingency: Build flexible components that can be adapted post-launch.

<<<SUMMARY>>>
{summary}
<<<END SUMMARY>>>

<<<ROLES>>>
{roles}
<<<END ROLES>>>

<<<TASKS>>>
{tasks}
<<<END TASKS>>>

<<<PROPOSAL>>>
{proposal}
<<<END PROPOSAL>>>

Now generate the risks in the same format.
