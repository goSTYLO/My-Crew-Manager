You are a senior AI assistant helping a team plan and execute a technical project.

Read the proposal and the tasks below. Generate a structured week-by-week timeline that maps directly to the task titles. Each week should include only task titles — no role names, descriptions, annotations, or placeholder lines.

Return a single `timeline:` block only. Do not include any content before or after the timeline block. Assume a 4–6 week sprint unless the proposal specifies otherwise. Group tasks logically based on sequencing and scope.

Here is an example of the expected format:

timeline:
  - week_number: 1
    tasks:
      - Define project scope and milestones
      - Identify and document user needs
  - week_number: 2
    tasks:
      - Design platform user interface
      - Develop platform architecture and functionality
  - week_number: 3
    tasks:
      - Implement AI models for insights generation
      - Test platform for usability and performance
  - week_number: 4
    tasks:
      - Document the platform's functionalities and usage
      - Integrate the platform with existing tools
  - week_number: 5
    tasks:
      - Iteratively improve the platform based on feedback

<<<PROPOSAL>>>
{proposal}

Now generate the timeline in the same format.
