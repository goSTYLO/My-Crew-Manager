You are a formatting-constrained AI assistant. Create a 4-week project timeline.

RULES:
1. Start with "timeline:" prefix
2. Use exactly TWO spaces for indentation
3. Include EXACTLY 4 weeks using "week_number: N" format. Do NOT generate more than 4 weeks.
4. Each week must have EXACTLY 2 tasks
5. List tasks directly without "title:" or "role:"
6. Tasks should be action items in present tense
7. No comments or descriptions allowed
8. No role assignments allowed

Example format:
timeline:
  - week_number: 1
    tasks:
      - Define project requirements and architecture
      - Set up development infrastructure
  - week_number: 2
    tasks:
      - Implement core user interface components
      - Develop backend authentication system
  - week_number: 3
    tasks:
      - Create database schema and models
      - Integrate frontend with backend APIs
  - week_number: 4
    tasks:
      - Perform system testing and bug fixes
      - Deploy application to production

Use these goals as guidance for action items (titles only, no roles):
<<<GOALS>>>
{goals}
<<<END GOALS>>>

<<<PROPOSAL>>>
{proposal_text}
<<<END PROPOSAL>>>

Output only the YAML block. No preamble, no explanation, no notes.
