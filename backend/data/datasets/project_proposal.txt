Sample Project Proposal: AI-Powered Task Management
Platform
Project Title: MyCrewManager — Modular AI-Powered Task Management System
Objective:​
To develop a scalable web-based platform that enables project managers to assign tasks,
monitor progress, and receive AI-generated recommendations for team coordination and risk
mitigation.
Scope:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Backend: Django REST API with PostgreSQL
Frontend: React-based dashboard with real-time updates
AI Integration: Hugging Face models for task analysis and recovery planning
OCR Support: Donut model for parsing uploaded documents

Team Composition:
●​
●​
●​
●​

1 Backend Developer (Python, Django, DRF)
1 Frontend Developer (React, Tailwind)
1 AI Engineer (LLM orchestration, prompt design)
1 Project Manager

Timeline:​
4 weeks total
●​
●​
●​
●​

Week 1: Setup, schema design, and API scaffolding
Week 2: Frontend integration and basic task flows
Week 3: AI module integration and reviewer generation
Week 4: Testing, documentation, and deployment

Resources:
●​
●​
●​
●​

1 GPU-enabled machine (RTX 4050, 6GB VRAM)
GitHub repo with CI/CD pipeline
Access to Hugging Face and LangChain libraries
Internal dataset of 50+ project proposals for fine-tuning

Risks:
●​ Limited VRAM may restrict model size and batch inference
●​ Onboarding documentation is incomplete for new team members
●​ OCR parsing may fail on low-quality scans

●​ Timeline may slip if AI module integration requires refactoring
Success Criteria:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Functional task assignment and tracking
AI assistant generates actionable recommendations per proposal
Team onboarding is smooth and reproducible
Deployment is stable and documented
