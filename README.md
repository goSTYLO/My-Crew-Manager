### Enforced Invitation Flow Testing
The invitation system has been comprehensively tested with real API calls to ensure the enforced workflow functions correctly:

#### Test Scenarios Verified:
1. **Auto-add Project Creator as Member** ‚úÖ
   - Project creators automatically become members with "Owner" role
   - Verified with project "NOVA" creation

2. **Block Direct Member Creation** ‚úÖ
   - Direct ProjectMember creation returns HTTP 403 Forbidden
   - Clear error message with hint to use invitation system

3. **Create Invitation** ‚úÖ
   - Invitations created successfully for target users
   - Proper status tracking (pending ‚Üí accepted)

4. **Invitee Not Yet Member** ‚úÖ
   - Invited users are NOT members until acceptance
   - Only project creators are members initially

5. **Accept Invitation** ‚úÖ
   - Invitation acceptance creates membership automatically
   - Proper role assignment (Member role for invitees)

6. **Invitee Now Member** ‚úÖ
   - Accepted invitees become project members
   - Both Owner and Member roles properly assigned

7. **Invitation Status Updated** ‚úÖ
   - Status changes from "pending" to "accepted"
   - Proper audit trail maintained

#### Test Commands Used:
```bash
# Create project (auto-adds creator as Owner)
POST /api/ai/projects/ - {"title": "NOVA", "summary": "Test project"}

# Attempt direct member creation (should fail)
POST /api/ai/project-members/ - {"project": 12, "user": 2, "role": "Member"}

# Create invitation (should succeed)
POST /api/ai/invitations/ - {"project": 12, "invitee": 2, "message": "Join our project!"}

# Accept invitation (should create membership)
POST /api/ai/invitations/6/accept/

# Verify membership creation

#### Custom Toast Notification System Implementation:
1. **Browser Alert Replacement**: Replaced all browser `alert()` calls with professional toast notifications
   - **Files Updated**: `monitor_created.tsx` (28 alerts), `generateProject.tsx` (36 alerts), `projects_main.tsx` (2 alerts), `settings.tsx` (1 alert)
   - **New Components**: Created `Toast.tsx` and `ToastContext.tsx` for global toast management
   - **Features**: 4 toast types (success, error, warning, info), themed design, auto-dismiss, manual close, smooth animations
   - **Integration**: Added `ToastProvider` to `App.tsx` for global toast functionality

2. **Team Invitation Bug Fixes**: Fixed critical 400/403 errors in team invitation system
   - **Root Cause**: Incorrect API endpoint and request format in `monitor_created.tsx`
   - **Solution**: Updated `handleInvite` function to follow correct logic from `generateProject.tsx`
   - **Changes**: Added user lookup by email, changed from `invitee_email` to `invitee` (user ID), proper error handling
   - **Result**: Team invitations now work correctly with proper user validation and error messages

#### Backlog Section Issues Fixed:
1. **TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')**: Fixed nested data structure mismatch between API response and frontend expectations
   - **Root Cause**: API returned `epics` with `sub_epics` ‚Üí `user_stories` ‚Üí `tasks` structure, but frontend expected flattened arrays
   - **Solution**: Updated `fetchBacklog()` to correctly transform nested API response to nested frontend structure
   - **Files Modified**: `web/src/view_pages/manager/monitor_created.tsx` (lines 1539+)

2. **Missing Edit Mode for Backlog**: Backlog section lacked the edit button pattern used in project overview
   - **Root Cause**: Backlog was immediately editable without user control
   - **Solution**: Added `isEditingBacklog` state and wrapped all editing functionality with conditional rendering
   - **Implementation**: Edit/Cancel/Save Changes buttons, conditional input fields, delete buttons, and add buttons

3. **Title Changes Not Saved to Database**: Backlog title edits were only updating local state
   - **Root Cause**: No API calls to persist title changes to backend
   - **Solution**: Implemented individual update functions and batch save functionality
   - **API Functions Added**: `updateEpicTitle()`, `updateSubEpicTitle()`, `updateUserStoryTitle()`, `updateTaskTitle()`, `saveBacklogChanges()`

4. **Missing Modal-Based CRUD**: Backlog used `prompt()` dialogs instead of professional modals
   - **Root Cause**: Inconsistent UI/UX compared to other sections
   - **Solution**: Implemented modal-based add/delete operations with contextual information
   - **Modals Added**: Add Epic, Add Sub-Epic, Add User Story, Add Task, Delete Confirmation

5. **Data Structure Inconsistencies**: Frontend expected different property names than backend provided
   - **Root Cause**: API used snake_case (`sub_epics`, `user_stories`) while frontend expected camelCase (`subEpics`, `userStories`)
   - **Solution**: Added proper data transformation in `fetchBacklog()` function
   - **Property Mapping**: `sub_epics` ‚Üí `subEpics`, `user_stories` ‚Üí `userStories`, `title` properties throughout

#### AI Regeneration System Enhancements:
1. **Timeline Storage Bug**: Fixed timeline items not being stored during project overview regeneration
   - **Root Cause**: LLM output uses `goals` key for timeline items, but backend expected `items` key
   - **Solution**: Updated `generate_overview` endpoint to handle both `goals` and `items` formats
   - **Files Modified**: `ai_api/views.py` (lines 183-199)

2. **LLM Output Format Handling**: Fixed `AttributeError` when LLM returns features/roles/goals as strings instead of objects
   - **Root Cause**: Backend expected objects with `.get('title')` but LLM sometimes returns simple strings
   - **Solution**: Added `isinstance(item, str)` checks to handle both string and object formats
   - **Implementation**: Proper string/object handling for features, roles, goals, and timeline items

3. **Enhanced Loading Experience**: Implemented dynamic loading messages for AI operations
   - **New Component**: `LoadingSpinner.tsx` with rotating messages like "AI is thinking...", "Analyzing your proposal..."
   - **Integration**: Added to `generateProject.tsx` and `monitor_created.tsx` for AI operations
   - **UX Improvement**: Full-screen overlay during AI operations to prevent user interaction

4. **Regeneration Success Modals**: Added professional success modals for AI regeneration operations
   - **New Component**: `RegenerationSuccessModal.tsx` with type-specific styling (blue for overview, green for backlog)
   - **Features**: Contextual success messages, themed design, proper visual feedback
   - **Replacement**: Replaced `alert()` calls with professional modal dialogs

#### Code Quality Improvements:
- **TypeScript Safety**: Added proper type annotations and optional chaining throughout
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback via toast notifications
- **State Management**: Proper React state management for nested data structures
- **UI Consistency**: All backlog functionality now matches project overview patterns
- **Performance**: Parallel API calls for batch operations using `Promise.all()`
- **User Experience**: Professional toast notifications instead of jarring browser alerts
- **Theme Integration**: All new components support dark/light theme switching

### Technical Issues Resolved (Previous Sessions)
During previous development sessions, we identified and resolved multiple critical issues:

#### Backend Issues Fixed:
1. **User Model Primary Key Mismatch**: Fixed all references from `User.id` to `User.user_id` across:
   - `ai_api/views.py` (line 440: `assignee.user.user_id`)
   - `ai_api/services/notification_service.py` (line 39: `notification.recipient.user_id`)
   - `ai_api/consumers.py` (line 11: `self.scope['user'].user_id`)
   - `ai_api/tests.py` (5 instances of `self.user.user_id`)

2. **Serializer Validation Issues**: Made `invited_by` field read-only in `ProjectInvitationSerializer` to prevent validation errors

3. **Notification System Resilience**: Added try-catch blocks to handle Redis connection failures gracefully

4. **Admin Integration**: Added `save()` method to `ProjectInvitation` model to automatically create `ProjectMember` when status changes to 'accepted' via Django admin

#### Frontend Issues Fixed:
1. **API URL Mismatch**: Corrected frontend calls from `/api/users/` to `/api/user/` to match backend configuration

2. **Data Type Conversion**: Added `parseInt()` to convert string IDs to integers for proper foreign key relationships

3. **TypeScript Interface Alignment**: Updated interfaces to match backend data structures

4. **State Management**: Implemented proper nested data handling with auto-expansion for backlog items

#### Integration Improvements:
1. **Complete CRUD Operations**: Implemented full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for all backlog entities
2. **Real-time Updates**: Backlog refreshes automatically after any CRUD operation
3. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
4. **Authentication**: Proper Bearer token authentication for all API calls
