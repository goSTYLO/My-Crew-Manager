- **Enforced Invitation Flow** - ALL member additions must go through invitation acceptance
- **Duplicate Prevention** - Prevents multiple pending invitations to the same user
- **Automatic Membership** - Accepting an invitation automatically creates project membership
- **Status Tracking** - Track invitation status (pending, accepted, declined, expired)
- **Cleanup Management** - Automatic cleanup of old declined invitations

### Notification System Test Suite
The notification system includes a comprehensive test suite (`ai_api/tests.py`) with **32 automated tests**:

- **Model Tests**: Verify notification creation, types, relationships, and ordering
- **Service Tests**: Test notification service layer and WebSocket payload generation
- **API Tests**: Validate all REST endpoints with authentication and authorization
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of invitation notification flow
- **WebSocket Tests**: Real-time delivery, channel management, and user isolation

**Test Coverage**: 100% of notification-related code including models, services, API endpoints, and WebSocket consumers.

### Enforced Invitation Flow Testing
The invitation system has been comprehensively tested with real API calls to ensure the enforced workflow functions correctly:

#### Test Scenarios Verified:
1. **Auto-add Project Creator as Member** ‚úÖ
   - Project creators automatically become members with "Owner" role
   - Verified with project "NOVA" creation

2. **Block Direct Member Creation** ‚úÖ
   - Direct ProjectMember creation returns HTTP 403 Forbidden
   - Clear error message with hint to use invitation system

3. **Create Invitation** ‚úÖ
   - Invitations created successfully for target users
   - Proper status tracking (pending ‚Üí accepted)

4. **Invitee Not Yet Member** ‚úÖ
   - Invited users are NOT members until acceptance
   - Only project creators are members initially

5. **Accept Invitation** ‚úÖ
   - Invitation acceptance creates membership automatically
   - Proper role assignment (Member role for invitees)

6. **Invitee Now Member** ‚úÖ
   - Accepted invitees become project members
   - Both Owner and Member roles properly assigned

7. **Invitation Status Updated** ‚úÖ
   - Status changes from "pending" to "accepted"
   - Proper audit trail maintained

#### Test Commands Used:
```bash
# Create project (auto-adds creator as Owner)
POST /api/ai/projects/ - {"title": "NOVA", "summary": "Test project"}

# Attempt direct member creation (should fail)
POST /api/ai/project-members/ - {"project": 12, "user": 2, "role": "Member"}

# Create invitation (should succeed)
POST /api/ai/invitations/ - {"project": 12, "invitee": 2, "message": "Join our project!"}

# Accept invitation (should create membership)
POST /api/ai/invitations/6/accept/

# Verify membership creation
GET /api/ai/project-members/?project_id=12
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
# Web app tests
cd web
npm test

# Mobile app tests
cd mobile/mycrewmanager
flutter test
```
